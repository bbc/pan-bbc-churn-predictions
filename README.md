# Details
  
#### How was the project initiated?

Discussion internal to the Data Science team around the absence of churn modelling in the BBC.

#### What was the goal of the project

Establishing a scale-able framework for churn modelling across products, with a long-term goal of a pan-BBC churn predictions and forecasting.

#### Outputs

- There is a notebook walkthrough of the model design [here](https://github.com/bbc/pan-bbc-churn/blob/master/churn-train.ipynb).
- There is also a notebook on interpreting the model [here](https://github.com/bbc/pan-bbc-churn/blob/master/churn-fi.ipynb).

#### Next steps

- Extending to scoring new data
- Tuning and optimisation
- Additional logistic regression on PCA reduced data
- Unsupervised segmentation as a weak learner
- Neural Network as a weak learner

#### Could this be applied to other products?

One of the core goals for pan-BBC churn modelling is a scale-able model that can be freely applied to other products with minimal re-engineering.

#### Actioning needed (if any) 

N/A.
